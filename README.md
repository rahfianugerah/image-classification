## About TensorFlow
TensorFlow is an open-source software library developed by Google for numerical computation, large-scale machine learning, and deep learning. 
It provides a flexible platform for building and deploying powerful machine learning models. [Click here!](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)

## TensorFlow Key Features
- Machine Learning Focused: TensorFlow offers a wide range of tools and APIs specifically designed for machine learning tasks, including data preparation, model building, training, and deployment.
- Flexible Architecture: The library supports various programming languages like Python, C++, and Java, allowing developers to choose the language that best suits their needs.
- High-Level APIs: Keras, a high-level API built on top of TensorFlow, simplifies model building with a user-friendly interface.
- Production Deployment: TensorFlow offers tools and libraries for deploying trained models in various environments, from servers and mobile devices to web browsers and edge devices.

## Benefits of Using TensorFlow
- Fast Prototyping: Keras and other high-level APIs enable rapid experimentation and model development.
- Scalability: TensorFlow can handle large datasets and complex models, making it suitable for real-world machine learning applications.
- Community and Resources: TensorFlow has a vast and active community of developers, researchers, and enthusiasts, providing extensive documentation, tutorials, and support.

## Who Uses TensorFlow?
TensorFlow is used by a wide range of organizations and individuals for various applications, including:

- Image Recognition: Classifying objects, faces, or scenes in images.
- Natural Language Processing: Analyzing text data for sentiment analysis, machine translation, or chatbots.
- Recommender Systems: Personalizing recommendations for products, movies, or music based on user preferences.
- Scientific Computing: Solving complex scientific problems with numerical computations.

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a model that can classify images of hand gestures representing rock, paper, or scissors. 
We'll achieve this using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture with TensorFlow and Keras.

## Project Key Components
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): A deep learning architecture specifically designed for image recognition. It extracts features from images through convolutional layers and learns to differentiate between classes.
- Adam Optimizer: An optimization algorithm that efficiently updates the weights and biases within the CNN during training, improving the model's accuracy.
- ImageDataGenerator: A tool from Keras for data augmentation. It artificially creates variations of existing images (flips, rotations, etc.) to increase the training dataset size and improve model generalization.
